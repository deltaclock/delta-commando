Welcome to Commando VM - Red Team Edition! This distribution contains a number
of Tools and configurations to enhance Red Teaming and Penetration Testing.

Please make sure to take a snapshot after installing so you can always revert
back if you have issues.

This image has the Chocolatey package manager installed, and you can continue to
customize this machine with any package from the Chocolatey repository - 
https://chocolatey.org/packages or from our repo - 
https://github.com/fireeye/commando-vm/blob/master/packages.csv.

Try this:
  choco install github 
Or:
  cinst github

To keep this distribution up to date, type this into an Administrative terminal:
  cup all

As this is a Red Teaming and Penetration Testing build certain protections have
been disabled, and certain 'risky' features and tweaks have been enabled.

Please enjoy the VM and submit any feedback or feature requests as github 
issues here:
https://github.com/fireeye/commando-vm

For support or questions please join the #commando-vm channel in the BloodHoundGang
Slack or email the creators at commandovm@fireeye.com
